# Frontend Mentor Challenge - To-do App

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](public/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- React JS.
- React beautiful drag-and-drop library.
- Chat GPT-3 for some implementations and troubleshooting.

### What I learned

- This is my first project using a JavaScript framework. It wasn't easy, since there are still basic JavaScript concepts that I am still learning. it was an excellent challenge for learning how to use React libraries and React concepts.

### What can be improve

- HTML can be more semantic and CSS could be implemented with BEM. I'm still learning those concepts.
